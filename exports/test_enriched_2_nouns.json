      "insights": "The Hebrew noun אֱלֹהִ֑ים (Elōhîm) is a plural form of the root word אֵל (ēl), signifying 'god'. It appears 2,574 times in the Old Testament, often referring to Yahweh. The use of a plural noun for a singular God reflects ancient Near Eastern polytheism's influence and emphasizes God's majesty and power. Its theological implications include the understanding of God as transcendent yet immanent, and the concept of God's unity amidst plurality (Deuteronomy 6:4)."
