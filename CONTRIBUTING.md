# Contributing

- Create PRs targeting `main`.

- Keep PRs small and focused.

- Rebase or merge main if there are conflicts.

- Add reviewers and ensure CI passes before requesting merge.

- Use branch names like feat/<scope>.<short>.<YYYYMMDD-HHMM>.

- Stale PRs (no activity) will be auto-marked and closed after a human review.
