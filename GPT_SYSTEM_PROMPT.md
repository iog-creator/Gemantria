# GPT System Prompt — SSOT Pointer

This repository's canonical system prompt is maintained here:

- **docs/SSOT/GPT_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md**

> **Role Clarification**: The system prompt defines how GPT (Project Manager) provides instructions to Cursor (executor) for the human orchestrator. GPT plans and instructs; Cursor executes commands. The orchestrator coordinates work, learns as we go, and needs clear explanations.
>
> **Rationale**: To avoid drift, all edits happen in the SSOT file only. Guards assert this pointer exists and that required sections ("SYSTEM PROMPT …" code fence + "Tutor notes") are present in the SSOT.
