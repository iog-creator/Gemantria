# GPT System Prompt — SSOT Pointer

This repository's canonical system prompt is maintained here:

- **docs/SSOT/GPT_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md**

> Rationale: to avoid drift, all edits happen in the SSOT file only. Guards assert
> this pointer exists and that required sections ("SYSTEM PROMPT …" code fence +
> "Tutor notes") are present in the SSOT.
