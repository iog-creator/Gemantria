The letters themselves offer no immediate clarity on their meaning, but the gematria value is significant. In gematria, numbers often correspond to divine names or attributes. The number 46 is close to the numerical value of the Tetragrammaton (YHWH), which is 26. This proximity suggests a potential connection to divine presence or revelation. However, without a clear context or primary verse, definitive interpretation is challenging. Theologically, this could symbolize an unknown aspect of God's nature or a hidden truth waiting to be revealed. It might also represent a mysterious entity or place in the biblical narrative, echoing the enigmatic nature of many divine encounters and revelations throughout Scripture."}, "status": "pending_review"}

The gematria value of 350 is significant as it mirrors the numerical value of the Tetragrammaton (YHWH), suggesting a potential connection to divine presence or revelation. The letters themselves offer clues: 'Shin' often symbolizes fire or divine judgment, while 'Mem' can represent water, life, or chaos. 'Yod', the smallest letter, signifies a seed or spark of life. The final 'Mem' may indicate completion or return. If this noun refers to a person or place, it could signify a source of life and judgment, perhaps a metaphor for God's role in history. Theologically, it might connect to themes of divine intervention (Judges 5:4-5), the chaos-to-order transformation (Genesis 1:2), or the fiery trial that refines believers (1 Peter 4:17).

Its gematria value of 201 is significant as it mirrors the numerical value of the Tetragrammaton (YHWH) in reverse, suggesting a profound connection between the land and its divine creator. Theologically, Aretz represents not just physical territory but also the people who inhabit it (Lev 18:25-30), reflecting God's covenantal promise to Abraham (Gen 12:7). It symbolizes the locus of God's redemptive history and the arena where His people are to live out their faith. The classification as a 'thing' is apt, given that Aretz is often personified in Scripture (Isa 24:5), highlighting its spiritual significance. The noun's initial meaning, while not explicitly analyzed, likely points to the land of Israel, which is central to God's redemptive plan."}, "status": "pending_review"}

Their combination suggests a concept of dynamic protection or moving safeguard, which could metaphorically apply to divine guardianship in the biblical narrative. The gematria value of 358 is significant as it approximates the numerical value of the Tetragrammaton (YHWH), hinting at a potential connection to God's presence and providence. However, without a specific context or primary verse, the exact theological significance remains elusive. Further study is needed to determine if this noun is a proper name, a place, or an abstract concept, each possibility offering distinct theological implications.

'\u05d5' typically represents 'nail' or 'peg,' implying stability, foundation, or even crucifixion in a broader biblical context. The final letter '\u05e3' can denote 'mouth' or 'speech,' signifying communication, prophecy, or the spoken word. Together, they could symbolize God's all-seeing, steadfast, and prophetic nature, echoing themes of divine revelation (Isaiah 46:10) and human response (Psalm 38:9). The gematria value 76 is significant as it equals the sum of the values for 'light' (\u05d0\u05d5\u05e8 - 207), 'life' (\u05d7\u05d9\u05d9 - 21), and 'peace' (\u05e9\u05dc\u05d5\u05dd - 340), hinting at a potential connection to spiritual illumination, vitality, and tranquility.

The classification as 'Unknown' invites exploration into biblical enigmas and hidden meanings. It could symbolize the unknown aspects of God's nature ('I AM that I AM', Exodus 3:14), or represent mysterious biblical figures like Melchizedek (Genesis 14:18-20).
