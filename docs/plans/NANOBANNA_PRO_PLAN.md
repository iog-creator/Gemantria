# Nanobanna Pro: The AI Site Builder

**Status:** ACTIVE
**Version:** 3.0
**Codename:** Nanobanna
**Engine:** Gemini 3 Pro Visual Engine (Integrated)

## 1. The Reality

**Nanobanna Pro** is not a third-party tool. It is **Me**.
It is the advanced visual engine integrated into my core (Gemini).

When you ask me to "build the website" with Nanobanna Pro, you are asking me to use my internal **Generative Image Capabilities** (`generate_image`) to construct the visual reality of the project.

## 2. The Builder's Role

I do not just "code" the website. I **visualize** it first, then manifest it.

1.  **Generate:** I use Nanobanna Pro to create high-fidelity visual assets (backgrounds, UI textures, layouts, avatars).
2.  **Construct:** I write the code (HTML/CSS/React) to frame and display these assets.
3.  **Vanish:** The AI builder steps back, leaving a fully constructed, visually stunning "Place" that runs natively in the browser.

## 3. The Blueprint (What I Will Build)

I will use Nanobanna Pro to generate the following "construction materials" for the Orchestrator Dashboard, adhering to the **"Organic Flow"** aesthetic (Minimalist, Fluid, Conceptual).

### 3.1 The Sanctuary (Environment)
*   **Prompt Strategy:** "Abstract liquid light background, soft flowing gradients, deep indigo and violet, ethereal data mist, 8k resolution, calm and intelligent atmosphere, no hard lines."
*   **Output:** High-res background assets that define a mood of "Flow" and "Intelligence".

### 3.2 The Glass (UI Kit)
*   **Prompt Strategy:** "Clean glassmorphism UI panel, soft white transparency, subtle drop shadow, rounded corners, minimalist, water-like clarity, isolated on black."
*   **Output:** A bespoke "Crystal Kit" of panels and buttons. No neon borders. Soft, organic separation.

### 3.3 The Avatars (Agents)
*   **Prompt Strategy:** "Abstract concept art of artificial intelligence, fluid geometry, glowing soft light, divine intellect, minimalist, ethereal, icon style, black background."
*   **Output:** Unique visual identities for `pmagent` (Logic), `BibleScholar` (Wisdom), and `Ollama` (Compute).

## 4. Execution Workflow

1.  **Commission:** You give the order (e.g., "Build the Inference Tile").
2.  **Visualize:** I call `generate_image` with a Nanobanna-optimized prompt.
3.  **Review:** I present the generated asset.
4.  **Integrate:** I write the React code to embed the asset, ensuring the website "looks" exactly like the vision.

## 5. Next Steps

*   **Immediate:** Wire the Autopilot Chat (Technical Foundation).
*   **Next:** Activate Nanobanna Pro to generate the "Master Environment" (Visual Foundation).
