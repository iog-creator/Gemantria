# AGENTS.md - Architectural Decision Records Directory

## Directory Purpose

The `docs/ADRs/` directory contains Architectural Decision Records that document significant design decisions, trade-offs, and rationales for the Gemantria project. ADRs ensure maintainability and knowledge transfer.

- **descriptive-title**: Hyphen-separated, URL-friendly
- **Example**: `ADR-010-qwen-integration.md`

## ADR Lifecycle Management

### Status Values

- **Proposed**: Initial draft, under discussion
- **Accepted**: Approved for implementation
- **Rejected**: Considered but not chosen
- **Deprecated**: No longer relevant
- **Superseded**: Replaced by newer ADR (reference new one)

### Decision Categories

#### Architecture Decisions

- System component design and relationships
- Data flow and processing patterns
- External service integration strategies
- Scalability and performance approaches

#### Technical Decisions

- Programming language and framework choices
- Database schema and indexing strategies
- API design and interface contracts
- Algorithm selection and optimization

#### Process Decisions

- Development workflow and tooling
- Testing strategy and quality gates
- Deployment and operational procedures
- Documentation and knowledge management

#### Dependency Decisions

- External library and service adoption
- Version compatibility and upgrade paths
- Licensing and security considerations
- Maintenance and support planning

## ADR Content Standards

### Required Sections

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Clear, Actionable Title]

## Status

[Current status from lifecycle]

## Related ADRs

[Links to related architectural decisions]

## Related Rules

[Links to cursor rules implementing or enforcing this decision]

## Context

[Problem statement, constraints, requirements]

## Decision

[Chosen solution, clearly stated]

## Rationale

[Why chosen, benefits, trade-offs]

## Alternatives Considered

[Other options with pros/cons]

## Consequences

[Implementation requirements, risks, follow-ups]

## Notes

[Additional context, references, future considerations]
```

### Cross-Referencing Requirements

- **Related ADRs**: All ADRs must reference related decisions with direct links
- **Related Rules**: ADRs must link to cursor rules that implement or enforce the decision
- **Implementation Links**: ADRs should reference PRs, issues, and code changes
- **Status Dependencies**: ADRs should indicate prerequisite ADRs that must be accepted first

### Quality Criteria

- **Context**: Sufficient background for decision understanding
- **Decision**: Clear, unambiguous statement of choice
- **Rationale**: Logical explanation with quantified benefits
- **Alternatives**: Fair evaluation of other options
- **Consequences**: Realistic assessment of impacts

## ADR Maintenance Workflow

### Creating New ADRs

1. **Identify Decision**: Recognize need for architectural choice
2. **Draft ADR**: Follow template with comprehensive analysis
3. **Socialize**: Share with team for feedback and refinement
4. **Finalize**: Incorporate feedback and mark status
5. **Implement**: Track implementation in related issues/PRs

### Updating Existing ADRs

1. **Context Change**: Monitor for invalidating conditions
2. **Status Update**: Mark deprecated/superseded as needed
3. **Reference Updates**: Ensure links remain accurate
4. **Implementation Drift**: Update when code diverges from decision

### ADR Review Process

1. **Technical Review**: Validate technical accuracy
2. **Stakeholder Review**: Ensure alignment with goals
3. **Implementation Review**: Verify feasibility and requirements
4. **Documentation Review**: Check clarity and completeness

## ADR Discovery & Usage

### Finding Relevant ADRs

- **By Topic**: Search ADR titles and content
- **By Status**: Filter by current/rejected/proposed
- **By Component**: Cross-reference with code areas
- **By Timeline**: Chronological decision evolution

### Using ADRs in Development

- **New Features**: Check for conflicting or related decisions
- **Refactoring**: Understand original design intent
- **Onboarding**: Learn system architecture and rationale
- **Troubleshooting**: Understand trade-offs and constraints

## ADR Analytics & Insights

### Decision Patterns

- **Common Themes**: Identify recurring decision types
- **Success Metrics**: Track implementation success rates
- **Learning Opportunities**: Analyze rejected decisions

### Quality Metrics

- **Completeness**: Required sections present and filled
- **Clarity**: Decision and rationale clearly stated
- **Relevance**: Current applicability to codebase
- **Maintenance**: Regular updates and status changes

## Tooling & Automation

### ADR Management Tools

- **Templates**: Standardized document structure
- **Validation**: Automated quality and completeness checks
- **Search**: Full-text search across ADR corpus
- **Linking**: Cross-reference between related ADRs

### Integration Points
