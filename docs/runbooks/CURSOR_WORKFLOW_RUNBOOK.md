# Cursor Workflow Runbook

This runbook summarizes how Cursor and other IDE-integrated agents should behave.

## Where to Find the Full Contracts

- PM contract: docs/SSOT/PM_CONTRACT_STRICT_SSOT_DMS.md
- Cursor workflow contract: docs/SSOT/CURSOR_WORKFLOW_CONTRACT.md

## Day-to-Day Expectations

- Always follow OPS blocks from the PM as the primary instructions.
- Use SSOT + DMS as the source of truth, not old chats or random attachments.
- Fix technical errors autonomously and report back with:
  - What was run
  - What changed
  - Any remaining issues that require PM direction
