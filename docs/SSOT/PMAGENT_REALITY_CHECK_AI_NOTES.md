# pmagent reality.check Summary

## What This Check Actually Does Today
`pmagent reality.check` is a single command that validates your environment before running more complex workflows. It checks:

1. **Env & DSN**: Ensures all necessary environment variables and Data Source Names (DSNs) are set correctly.
2. **DB & Control Plane**: Verifies database connectivity and control plane schema integrity.
3. **LM & Models**: Confirms that language model providers and slots are available.

It produces a JSON verdict for the control plane to store and outputs a short human-readable summary in the console. The command exits with `0` if everything is acceptable or non-zero if there are issues, depending on whether you're running in HINT (soft fail) or STRICT (hard fail) mode.

## How to Use It in Practice
To use `pmagent reality.check`, simply run:

```bash
pmagent reality.check --mode hint   # Default for local development
```

or

```bash
pmagent reality.check --mode strict  # For release workflows
```

You can also specify additional options like:
- `--no-dashboards` to skip dashboard checks.
- `--mode strict` explicitly set the mode.

## Open Questions or TODOs for the PM
1. **Mode Expansion**: Is there a need for more nuanced modes beyond HINT and STRICT?
2. **Error Handling**: How should we handle partial failures (e.g., missing LM models but DB is OK)?
3. **Integration with CI/CD**: Should this command be integrated into existing CI pipelines to automate reality checks?

These questions will help refine `pmagent reality.check` for broader use across the project.
