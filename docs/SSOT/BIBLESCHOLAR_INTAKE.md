# BibleScholar Intake — Unification Planning

This document tracks what we intend to port from BibleScholar-related projects
into the unified Gemantria.v2 framework.

## 1. Source projects

Initial candidates (from PROJECTS_INVENTORY):

- `BibleScholarProjectClean`

- `Gemantria` (older)

- `RippleAGI` (Bible-related mentions)

## 2. High-value modules / features (to be filled in)

- [ ] Core Bible text / passage handling

- [ ] Reference & cross-reference logic

- [ ] Any durable data models worth migrating

- [ ] LM / prompt patterns that align with the new control-plane

## 3. Items explicitly *not* ported

Use this section to record anything we deliberately leave behind
(e.g., obsolete UI layers, experimental pipelines that don't fit the new architecture).
