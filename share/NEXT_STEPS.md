## Phase 14 — BibleScholar Relationship Tables & Cross-Language Enhancement (LANDED)

Status: **LANDED on `main` via PR #592** (`feat(phase14-rescue)`).

Authoritative spec: `docs/SSOT/PHASE_14_SEMANTIC_RECORD.md`.

Summary:

* Adds BibleScholar relationship adapter and cross-language flows.
* Introduces DB-only lexicon and cross-language lemma resolution.
* Prepares enriched, DB-backed context for future RAG work.

Next planning consideration:

* Future phases (e.g., Phase 15) must treat Phase 14 as complete and use `PHASE_14_SEMANTIC_RECORD.md` as the SSOT for its capabilities.
