## Key Targets For Unification (to be refined manually)

- **Gemantria** (this repo): control-plane, LM budgets, Knowledge Slice, exports.

- **BibleScholar** (wherever located): Bible study domain logic; candidate to be refactored into a module within this framework.

- **StoryMaker / webui**: current React/Tailwind shell; likely the unified UI.

- **Other experimental projects**:

  - To be manually inspected (RAG prototypes, older Bible UIs, graph engines, etc.)

  - The PM (ChatGPT) will use this inventory in the next planning chat to decide:

    - What to harvest

    - What to deprecate

    - Where to create migration plans
