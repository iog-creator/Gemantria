# Orchestrator Notes Surface

This file is the primary freeform notes surface for the Orchestrator and PM.

## How to Use

- **Orchestrator**: Capture intent, constraints, and approvals here in human language.
- **PM**: Summarize key agreements, next phases, and what Cursor is currently doing.
- **Orchestrator Assistant (OA)**: When synthesizing research, add clearly labeled sections (e.g., "OA: Research summary on X").

## Conventions

- Use clear headings per topic or phase (e.g., "Phase 23 — Stress Epoch").
- When referencing evidence, include the path (e.g., `evidence/...` or `share/...`).
- Avoid implementation details; focus on **decisions** and **intent**.
