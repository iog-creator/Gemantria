# StoryMaker Intake — Unification Planning

This document tracks StoryMaker-related code and ideas that we plan to bring
into the unified React/Tailwind UI in Gemantria.v2.

## 1. Source projects

Initial candidates (from PROJECTS_INVENTORY):

- `StoryMaker`

- `Gemantria` (older StoryMaker integration notes)

## 2. High-value modules / features (to be filled in)

- [ ] Story flow logic / workflows

- [ ] Any existing React components/pages worth porting

- [ ] Prompt / LM usage patterns that survive into the new control-plane

## 3. Items explicitly *not* ported

Use this section to record anything we intentionally archive
(e.g. old UIs with poor UX, duplicated logic replaced by the new control-plane).
