      "description": "Rule 046 (Hermetic CI Fallbacks) allows graceful degradation for db_off scenarios in CI, while Rule 062 (Environment Validation) mandates auto-starting services for live operations. This creates ambiguity about when to use hermetic mode vs live mode.",

        "Rule 062: 4 live operation patterns found",

      "recommendation": "Clarify the distinction: Rule 046 applies to CI/hermetic contexts only, while Rule 062 applies to live development/operations. Add explicit context markers to both rules to prevent ambiguity."
