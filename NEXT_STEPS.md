# NEXT_STEPS (author: GPT-5)
## Branch
feature/ops-stabilize-package-guards-017

## Tasks (Cursor executes these)
- [ ] Ensure the following are present on this branch (diffs already applied):
      - Makefile: target `eval.verify.integrity.soft`; `ops.verify` uses soft gate; `targets.check.dupes`
      - scripts/eval/build_bundle.py: write-then-move; excludes *.tar.gz; no self-include
      - scripts/eval/build_release_manifest.py (or equivalent): skip share/eval/bundles/**
      - AGENTS.md: note pipeline stabilization behavior and soft-vs-hard gates
- [ ] Run evidence commands and paste tails under "Evidence tails".
- [ ] Open PR to `main` with the exact title/body below and push.
- [ ] Merge when CI is green and all acceptance checks are pasted & confirmed.

## Acceptance checks (Cursor pastes tails)
- `make eval.verify.integrity.soft` → prints FAIL (if mismatches) but exits 0
- `make eval.verify.integrity` → exits 1 on mismatches (hard gate intact)
- `timeout 300 make eval.package` → completes; no "overriding recipe" warnings; no `tar: ... file changed as we read it`
- `make targets.check.dupes` → `[targets.check.dupes] OK: no duplicates`
- `make ops.verify` → ends with `[ops.verify] OK`
- CI required gates pass on the PR (Rule-037, Rule-038, numbering, share drift, NEXT_STEPS)

## Status
- Cursor sets to **Done** when the PR is merged to `main` and all evidence is pasted.
