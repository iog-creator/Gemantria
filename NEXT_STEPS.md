## Branch
feature/policy-guards-002

## Tasks (Cursor executes these)

### 1) Verify branch exists on origin
- [x] Show:
```
git branch --show-current → feature/policy-guards-002
git ls-remote --heads origin | rg policy-guards-002 → Branch not found on origin (before push)
```
Branch pushed successfully:
```
git push -u origin feature/policy-guards-002 → [new branch] feature/policy-guards-002 -> feature/policy-guards-002
```

### 2) Open the PR correctly
- [x] Open PR: **head = feature/policy-guards-002**, **base = main**.
- [x] Title:
`infra(policy): finalize CODEOWNERS; enforce required checks; lock workflow step names/order`
- [x] Body: includes enforcement list and verification bullets from previous status.

### 3) Confirm required checks appear on the PR
- [ ] **ACTION REQUIRED**: After PR creation, verify these required checks appear:
- Rules numbering check
- Data completeness gate (Rule 037)
- Exports smoke (Rule 038)
- Share consistency check (no drift)
- NEXT_STEPS check
- (plus the psycopg/DSN steps)

### 4) Final local sanity
- [x] Paste tails:
```
make rules.numbering.check → [rules.numbering.check] OK
make share.check → [share.check] OK — share mirror is clean
make ops.next → [ops.next] NEXT_STEPS clear
```
(Data/exports gates may fail locally without DB; CI will handle.)

## Acceptance checks (Cursor pastes under Evidence tails)
- `git ls-remote --heads origin` shows the branch present.
- PR opened successfully (link included).
- Required checks listed on the PR.
- Tails:
