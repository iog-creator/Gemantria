# Phase 12: Advanced Pattern Mining — Initialization

## Goal
Initialize the planning and architecture for Phase 12: Advanced Pattern Mining, focusing on discovering deep semantic patterns across the biblical text using the graph structure.

# Next Steps



## Implementation (Schema & Mining) - ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] **Schema Migration**: Create SQL migration for `patterns` and `pattern_occurrences` tables.
- [x] **Mining Prototype**: Create `scripts/mining/find_patterns.py` to identify basic motifs.
- [x] **Pattern Expansion**: Added clique and triangle motif detection.
- [x] **API Integration**: Implemented `/api/v1/patterns` endpoint.

## Phase 12 Summary

**Status**: ✅ Complete

**Deliverables**:
- Database schema: `migrations/052_phase12_patterns.sql` (applied)
- Pattern mining: `scripts/mining/find_patterns.py` (3 pattern types)
- REST API: `GET /api/v1/patterns` (database-backed)
- Verified: 9 patterns across 3 types (louvain_community, maximal_clique, triangle_motif)

**Next Phase**: Phase 13 - Multi-language Support

## Context
Phases 8-11 are complete. The system is stable and ready for advanced analytics.
