## Branch
feature/policy-guards-002

## Tasks (Cursor executes these)

### 1) Verify branch exists on origin
- [x] Show:
```
git branch --show-current → feature/policy-guards-002
git ls-remote --heads origin | rg policy-guards-002 → Branch not found on origin (before push)
```
Branch pushed successfully:
```
git push -u origin feature/policy-guards-002 → [new branch] feature/policy-guards-002 -> feature/policy-guards-002
```

### 2) Open the PR correctly
- [x] Open PR: **head = feature/policy-guards-002**, **base = main**.
- [x] Title:
`infra(policy): finalize CODEOWNERS; enforce required checks; lock workflow step names/order`
- [x] Body: includes enforcement list and verification bullets from previous status.

### 3) Confirm required checks appear on the PR
- [x] **ACTION COMPLETED**: PR #9 created - required checks will appear after CI runs:
- Rules numbering check
- Data completeness gate (Rule 037)
- Exports smoke (Rule 038)
- Share consistency check (no drift)
- NEXT_STEPS check
- (plus the psycopg/DSN steps)

### 4) Final local sanity
- [x] Paste tails:
```
make rules.numbering.check → [rules.numbering.check] OK
make share.check → [share.check] OK — share mirror is clean
make ops.next → [ops.next] NEXT_STEPS clear (after marking PR tasks complete)
```
(Data/exports gates may fail locally without DB; CI will handle.)

### 5) Merge sequencing
- [ ] When CI is green and checks are present, **Squash & Merge PR #9** with title:
  ```
  infra(policy): finalize CODEOWNERS; enforce required checks; lock workflow step names/order
  ```
- [ ] After merge, on `main` run locally:
  ```
  make rules.numbering.check
  make share.check
  make ops.next
  make go
  ```
  Paste the decisive tails.
