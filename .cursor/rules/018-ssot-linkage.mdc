# Related ADRs: ADR-013 (Comprehensive documentation synchronization enhancement)

- **Purpose**: Ensure all SSOT docs are linked from ADRs and vice versa to maintain bidirectional documentation relationships.

- **ADR Requirements**: ADR text must contain "docs/SSOT/..." reference for each related SSOT document.

- **SSOT Requirements**: SSOT front matter must list originating ADR in "originating_ADR" field.

- **Linkage Validation**:
  - ADRs must have "Related SSOT" section
  - SSOT docs must have "--- originating_ADR: ADR-XXX ---" header
  - Cross-references must be consistent and bidirectional

- **Validation**: Run `grep -r "docs/SSOT/" docs/ADRs/` and verify all SSOT docs are referenced.

- **Failure Mode**: Broken documentation links prevent complete architectural traceability.
