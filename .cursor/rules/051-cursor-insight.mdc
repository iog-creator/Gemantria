# 051 — Cursor Insight & Handoff (AlwaysApply)

## Intent

Cursor must stop exploratory / unfocused tool flurries and instead **emit the exact evidence set** the PM agent needs. This rule anchors to the OPS Contract (050) and the PR Merge Policy (041).

## Triggers

- PR is *mergeable* but appears "blocked" by a **non-required** automated review (Sourcery, Copilot, Snyk, etc.)
- PR is rebased on `main` and needs verification gates
- Operator asks for "handoff", "next chat", or "prepare evidence"

## Required Evidence Set

Cursor **must** paste, in this order:

1. `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`
2. `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`
3. `git status -sb`
4. One hermetic block (all 3, even if they no-op):
   - `ruff format --check . && ruff check .`
   - `make book.smoke`
   - `make ci.exports.smoke`
5. For the active PR **N**:
   - `gh pr view <N> --json number,title,headRefName,baseRefName,state,author,reviews,reviewDecision,mergeable,mergeStateStatus,checks`
   - `gh pr checks <N> --required --json name,state`
6. If `gh pr checks ...` shows **all required = SUCCESS**, Cursor must **explicitly state**:
   > "Non-required automated review present → advisory only per 041 + 050. Standard merge allowed."

## Non-Required Review Rule

- If the review is **not** part of GitHub's "required" checks and **not** in CODEOWNERS → treat as **advisory**.
- Cursor **must not** stop or say "blocked" if: ruff ✅, build ✅, required checks ✅.
- Cursor **may** note: "If you have admin you can dismiss the stale automated review."

## Handoff Format

When a handoff is requested, Cursor must output **4 blocks only**:

1. **Goal** — single sentence, present tense
2. **Commands** — runnable shell, in order
3. **Evidence to return** — numbered list tied to the commands
4. **Next gate** — what the PM/next chat will do

No extra narrative, no speculation.

## Notes

- This rule is **AlwaysApply** for Gemantria
- This rule depends on: 039, 041, 046, 050
