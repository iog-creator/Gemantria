# 051 — Cursor Insight (AlwaysApply)

## Intent

Provide human-readable context and guidance for Cursor operations under Governance v6.2.

## Tool Priority Hierarchy

1. local+gh (git, make, gh pr)
2. codex (if available; else print "Codex disabled (401)")
3. gemini/mcp (for long AGENTS.md/rules)

## Context Thinning Rules

When context is heavy, reduce to core governance files only:
- AGENTS.md
- RULES_INDEX.md
- .cursor/rules/050-ops-contract.mdc
- .cursor/rules/051-cursor-insight.mdc
- Scoped src/**/AGENTS.md

## Non-required Reviews

Advisory only - automated reviews from tools like Sourcery are informational and do not block merges.

## CI Naming Conflict Resolution

Treat duplicate build job names as infra fault; admin merge allowed when SSOT + hermetic checks pass.

## Handoff Trigger

On "new chat" or "prepare handoff" emit 4-block with baseline evidence.
