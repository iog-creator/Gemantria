# 053 — Idempotent Baseline (OPS v6.2.1)

## Intent

Prevent repetitive baseline evidence requests when branch and SHA haven't changed.

## When to skip

Skip baseline re-runs when:
- Git branch unchanged AND HEAD SHA unchanged within 60m
- Previous evidence cache includes ruff+smoke tails for same commit/branch

## Behavior

- Acknowledge prior evidence; DO NOT re-run baseline
- Use 'HINT[baseline.sha]: <sha>' marker in outputs
- Cache evidence for 60m window

## Notes

Project rules are first-class in Cursor - this rule prevents OPS ritual repetition while maintaining governance coverage.
