# Cursor IDE Configuration Rules

This directory contains Cursor IDE configuration rules that enforce development standards, code quality, and project-specific policies. These rules automatically apply to relevant files and provide real-time guidance during development.

## üéØ Purpose

The rules directory serves as the enforcement layer for:

- **Code Quality Standards**: Automatic linting and formatting requirements
- **Project Policies**: Domain-specific rules for the Gemantria project
- **Development Workflow**: IDE-assisted enforcement of best practices
- **Safety Gates**: Critical validation rules that prevent common errors
- **Documentation Requirements**: Automatic checking of documentation completeness

## üîß Rule File Format

### Structure

Each rule file follows the Markdown Cursor (`.mdc`) format:

```mdc
---
description: Brief description of the rule's purpose
globs:
  - path/patterns/where/rule/applies
alwaysApply: true/false
---

# Rule content in Markdown format
# Enforcement criteria, examples, rationale
```

### Key Components

- **Description**: Clear, actionable summary of the rule's purpose
- **Globs**: File patterns where the rule should be applied
- **Always Apply**: Whether the rule applies universally or conditionally
- **Content**: Detailed enforcement criteria, examples, and rationale

## üìä Rule Application

### Automatic Application

Rules are automatically applied by Cursor IDE based on:

- **File Path Matching**: Glob patterns determine which files get which rules
- **Context Awareness**: Rules activate based on file content and project structure
- **Real-time Enforcement**: Immediate feedback during editing
- **Severity Levels**: Warnings vs. errors based on rule criticality

### Manual Verification

Rules can be manually verified using:

```bash
# Run documentation sync validation
./scripts/test_docs_sync_rule.sh

# Check specific rule compliance
# (Rules are enforced by Cursor IDE during development)
```

## üéØ Rule Development

### Creating New Rules

See the comprehensive guide in the main [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md#how-agents-should-use-rules) for detailed instructions on when and how to create Cursor rules, including:

- **When to Create Rules**: Critical safety issues, recurring problems, new standards, process improvements
- **Rule File Structure**: Naming conventions, numbering, and MDC format requirements
- **Glob Patterns**: Guidelines for efficient and effective file targeting
- **Always Apply Logic**: When to use global vs. conditional rules
- **Complete Workflow**: Step-by-step rule creation and validation process

### Rule Maintenance

1. **Monitor Effectiveness**: Track rule violation patterns and developer feedback
2. **Update Content**: Modify rules as project standards evolve
3. **Version Control**: Rules are versioned with project code via git
4. **Cross-Reference**: Ensure rules reference relevant ADRs and documentation
5. **Performance**: Monitor IDE impact and optimize glob patterns for efficiency

- **User-Friendly**: Rules should provide helpful guidance, not just restrictions
- **Regular Review**: Rules should be reviewed periodically for continued relevance

### Integration with Workflow

- **IDE Integration**: Rules work seamlessly within the development environment
- **CI/CD Compatibility**: Rules align with automated quality checks
- **Team Alignment**: Rules reflect and reinforce team standards and practices
