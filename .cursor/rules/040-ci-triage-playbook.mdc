title: CI Triage Playbook (surgical)
policy:
  - Minimal fixes only, within current PR scope.
  - Allowed self-heals (same PR):
    - De-duplicate Makefile targets; add missing .PHONY for new ones.
    - Add/repair share/SHARE_MANIFEST.json so share.sync passes.
    - Add mypy.ini with ignore_missing_imports = True (no code edits).
    - Add scripts/ci/db_ensure.sh and wire under verify targets.
  - Disallowed: changing workflows/governance, renaming gates, adding deps.
acceptance:
  - make -s ops.verify â†’ ends "[ops.verify] OK"
  - share.sync completes with no errors when required.
