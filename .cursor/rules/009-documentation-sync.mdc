- All ADR documents must be mirrored to `grok_share/docs/ADRs/` immediately after creation or modification.
- Use `cp docs/ADRs/ADR-*.md grok_share/docs/ADRs/` to maintain synchronization.
- This ensures documentation consistency between working directory and shareable artifacts.
- Violation: Documentation drift between main docs/ and grok_share/docs/ folders.
