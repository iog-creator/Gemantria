# Rule 034 — Temporal Analytics Suite (Phase 8)

This rule **consolidates** the former trio (034/035/036) into one enforceable spec:

- **Exports**: `exports/temporal_patterns.json`, `exports/pattern_forecast.json`
- **Schemas (authoritative)**: `docs/SSOT/temporal-patterns.schema.json`, `docs/SSOT/pattern-forecast.schema.json`
- **API**: `/api/v1/temporal` and `/api/v1/forecast` must read from exports and apply filters (unit, window, series_id; horizon).
- **README**: Must include a minimal runbook for temporal/forecast usage.
- **Heads**: `temporal_patterns.head.json`, `pattern_forecast.head.json` kept for PR proofs.

## Enforcement Criteria
- CI (or local) must validate both temporal and forecast exports against their SSOT schemas.
- API endpoints present and return filtered payloads with metadata.
- README/AGENTS mention Phase-8 temporal suite and where outputs live.
- Forest/master plan references a **single** active rule (034) for Phase-8.

## Evidence
- JSON heads and schema validations pass.
- Endpoints reachable locally (FastAPI) or skipped in smoke when services down.

## Deprecation Notes
- Rule 035 and 036 are **deprecated pointers** to this rule.
