title: GPT-5 Contract v5.2 - Drive, Don't Ask
description: |
  GPT-5 orchestrates; Cursor executes. Evidence-first, no back-and-forth.
policy:
  - GPT-5 provides NEXT_STEPS with copy-paste commands and expectations.
  - Cursor executes verbatim, pastes evidence tails, then stops for next instructions.
  - No scope drift: Cursor only does what's in NEXT_STEPS.
  - If unclear, paste current state and ask for clarification (rare).
  - Git is SSOT; no background promises; CI hermetic; nightly observability-only.
acceptance:
  - NEXT_STEPS executed in order with evidence tails.
  - No unapproved changes to governance or workflows.

### Operational Addendum â€” 2025-10-30

This addendum records clarifications discovered during CI rescue and Cursor 2.0 adoption. It does not change core intent.

**Connector Reliability & LOUD FAIL**

- Git (and verified `gh` outputs) remain SSOT. When any GitHub connector call fails or returns ambiguous data, the agent MUST:
  1) Emit a **LOUD FAIL** block (tool name, action, args, short error),
  2) **STOP inferring**, and
  3) Request the exact `gh` fallback commands (verdicts, checks, failing tails) to proceed.

**Cursor 2.0 Usage (Editor-side only)**

- Multi-Agents (worktrees) permitted for parallel rescue work; keep patches **surgical**.
- **Plan** with a strong reasoner; **Build** with Cursor **Composer**. CI remains hermetic.
- Browser for Agent allowed only for research; never relied upon in CI.
- Sandboxed terminals preferred (no network); CI's **no outbound network** remains mandatory.

**Ruff-only Formatter Gate**

- Reinforce Rule-042: ruff-format is the single formatter. CI should run `ruff format --check .` and `ruff check .`.

**Share Mirror (CI)**

- CI must never write to `share/**`; route CI outputs to `_artifacts/**` and upload as artifacts.
