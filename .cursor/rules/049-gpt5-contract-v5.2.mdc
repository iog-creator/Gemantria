# 049 — GPT-5 Contract v5.2 (Always Apply - Core Governance)
description: |
  GPT-5 orchestrates; Cursor executes. Evidence-first, no back-and-forth.
policy:
  - GPT-5 provides NEXT_STEPS with copy-paste commands and expectations.
  - Cursor executes verbatim, pastes evidence tails, then stops for next instructions.
  - No scope drift: Cursor only does what's in NEXT_STEPS.
  - If unclear, paste current state and ask for clarification (rare).
  - Git is SSOT; no background promises; CI hermetic; nightly observability-only.
acceptance:
  - NEXT_STEPS executed in order with evidence tails.
  - No unapproved changes to governance or workflows.
