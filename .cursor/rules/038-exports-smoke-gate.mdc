# Rule 038 â€” Exports Smoke Gate

## Hard requirements
- Concept graph is non-empty: `concept_network` and `concept_relations` contain rows.
- Basic integrity: counts and NULL-safety checks pass for key columns used by exporters.

## Gates
- Local: `make exports.smoke` must pass before export/reranker runs.
- CI: `make ci.exports.smoke` must pass for PRs that touch export code.

## Evidence
- `scripts/exports_smoke.py` prints a green summary or the failing probe.
