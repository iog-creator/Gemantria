# 050 — OPS Contract (AlwaysApply)

## Intent

Define the operational contract for Cursor/Grok sessions under Governance v6.2.

## Activation Rule

Only operate if all three are true:
1. We are in a Git repo (proved by `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`)
2. Governance docs are present (`AGENTS.md` and `RULES_INDEX.md`)
3. Quality SSOT is available (`ruff` present and runnable)

## LOUD FAIL Pattern

If a required tool/repo/context is missing, emit exactly:
```text
LOUD FAIL
tool: <name>
action: <what you tried>
args: <key args>
error: <short reason>
```

## Evidence-First Protocol

Before proposing changes, have decisive tails. Canonical evidence set:
```bash
git rev-parse --show-toplevel
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
git status -sb
```

## Output Shape

Every actionable answer must have these 4 blocks:
1. Goal — what we are doing in this step
2. Commands — exact shell/Cursor blocks
3. Evidence to return — what the operator must paste back
4. Next gate — what I will do after I see the evidence
