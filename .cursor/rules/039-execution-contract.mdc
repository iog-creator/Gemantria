title: Cursor Execution Contract (GPT-5 orchestrates; Cursor executes)
description: |
  Cursor executes commands, applies diffs, runs make/CI, and merges PRs.
  Cursor MUST follow NEXT_STEPS.md exactly. No scope drift.
policy:
  - Follow NEXT_STEPS.md in order. Paste evidence tails after each step.
  - If a command fails, paste last 40 lines and STOP for GPT-5 instructions.
  - Do not modify governance or workflows unless NEXT_STEPS explicitly says so.
acceptance:
  - Each step shows decisive OK/FAIL lines. Evidence pasted verbatim.
