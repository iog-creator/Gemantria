# Related ADR: ADR-001 (Two-DB Safety)

- Never INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE against bible_db.
- All SQL must use %s parameters; no f-strings or string interpolation.
- Add indices for expected query patterns; enforce unique(content_hash) where applicable.
- Provide migration tests that apply and rollback cleanly.
- Bible DB adapter must raise ReadOnlyViolation on any SQL starting with INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/MERGE/CREATE/ALTER/DROP/TRUNCATE/GRANT/REVOKE *before* opening a connection.
- Tests must include: (a) contract test exercising this guard without a DSN; (b) static scan forbidding f-strings in `.execute(...)` calls.
