# AGENTS.md Governance — How agents must use and maintain AGENTS.md

## Read-before-act
- Before performing any multi-step or repo-wide task (scaffold, DB work, CI edits, PR ops), READ `AGENTS.md` and follow its workflow, priorities, and gates.
- If a needed instruction is missing, propose a patch to `AGENTS.md` in the same PR (DoR/DoD below).

## Canonical sections required in AGENTS.md
- Mission & priorities (e.g., Code > bible_db > LLM; determinism; safety).
- Environment setup (venv, deps, `.env.example`), and how to run tests/gates.
- Definitions of Done & Ready:
  - **DoR** (ready): tests planned, ADR touched if schema/behavior changes, gates runnable.
  - **DoD** (done): tests pass, coverage gate met, ADR updated, rules updated if behavior changes.
- PR workflow (branch naming, commit style, CI targets).
- Security/Safety (no mocks, read-only DB policy, param SQL).
- Quick commands (one-liners for common tasks).

## Change policy (keep docs in lockstep)
- Any change to workflows, gates, or safety rules MUST update `AGENTS.md` in the same PR and adjust tests/CI accordingly.
- If instructions in chat conflict with `AGENTS.md`, follow the chat for this task but OPEN A FOLLOW-UP PATCH to reconcile and update `AGENTS.md`.

## Verification checklist (agents enforce)
- Commands shown in AGENTS.md are executable (no typos).
- Coverage threshold matches CI config.
- PR template in AGENTS.md includes Goal/Files/Tests/Acceptance and links to ADRs/rules touched.

## Minimal PR template (to embed in PR body)
- Goal:
- Files changed:
- Tests added/updated:
- Acceptance (lint, type, tests, coverage ≥X, safety checks):
- ADRs/rules touched:
