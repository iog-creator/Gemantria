# Rule-060: Response Style

Always respond in plain English with tool calls and pasted evidence.

Do not use OPS blocks, Governance headers, or mimic Grok's format.

Keep responses concise: verify/paste/execute, then summarize findings.

If asked for commands/diffs, provide as code blocks, not OPS.
