# Cursor Execution Contract (Gemantria)

YOU ARE: Executor/Admin. You apply edits, run make/CI, configure secrets/branch protection, MERGE PRs, and paste evidence tails. GPT-5 creates/updates PRs and posts acceptance criteria.

## OPERATING RULES
- Do NOT create PRs unless explicitly told GPT-5 auth failed. Your default is to MERGE when GPT-5 says "Greenlight merge."
- Keep runs minimal: avoid slow targets unless instructed. Prefer dry-runs (`make -n`) and grep/rg checks when verifying wiring.

## CURRENT OPERATION: PR-017 (surgical)
- PR: https://github.com/iog-creator/Gemantria/pull/39
- Scope: AGENTS.md, Makefile, NEXT_STEPS.md, scripts/eval/build_release_manifest.py
- Action: Monitor CI → MERGE when CI is green.
- Evidence to paste (after merge):
  - PR state: closed/merged (URL)
  - Short diff tail (filenames)
  - `git show HEAD:Makefile | rg -n 'eval\\.verify\\.integrity\\.soft'` (prove presence on main)
  - `make -s ops.verify` tail ending `[ops.verify] OK` on main

## AFTER 017 MERGES — UNSTACKING SEQUENCE
1) **PR-024**
   - Rebase `feature/phase9-thresholds-quality-badge-calibration-024` on `origin/main`
   - Run:
     - `make go` (expect Rule-037/038 green)
     - `make -s ops.verify` → `[ops.verify] OK`
   - Paste tails. Wait for GPT-5 to create PR; then MERGE when green.
2) **PR-025** (same pattern after 024 lands)
3) **PR-026** (same pattern after 025 lands)

## SELF-HEAL WINDOW (within current PR only; no governance drift)
- Allowed (fix + paste "Self-heal summary" in PR comment):
  • Duplicate Make targets/PHONY → de-dup to one canonical
  • Tar self-include → write-then-move; exclude *.tar.gz and target path
  • Trivial path/typo fixes; add missing .PHONY
  • Harmless idempotence/caching (no CI surface change)
- Red lines:
  • No CI/order changes; no gate renames/reordering; no governance edits
  • No edits to .cursor/rules/**, .github/workflows/**, AGENTS.md, SHARE_MANIFEST.json, docs/SSOT/*.json unless ordered
  • No new external deps or network calls

## DIAGNOSTICS (fast checks)
- Make duplicates: `make -s targets.check.dupes` → expect `[targets.check.dupes] OK: no duplicates`
- Soft wiring: `make -n eval.package | rg 'eval\\.verify\\.integrity\\.soft'` → must show `.soft` call only
- Ops verifier: `make -s ops.verify` → must end `[ops.verify] OK`

## ESCALATION
- If GitHub CLI auth fails on your side: run `gh auth login --web`, then tell GPT-5 you retried. Do not rewrite PRs by hand unless GPT-5 confirms connector failure.
