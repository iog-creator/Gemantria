# Rule 025 â€” Phase Gate & Forest Sync

**Purpose:**
Prevent drift between low-level PRs and the global project state.

## Must Exist
- `docs/forest/overview.md`
- `docs/DECISION_LOG.md`
- `docs/VERIFICATION_MATRIX.md`
- `scripts/generate_forest.py`

## Must Run
Developers **must run**:
```bash
python scripts/generate_forest.py
```

before opening or merging any new phase PR.

## Fails if

* Any listed file missing or empty
* overview.md not updated in past 24h
* verification matrix missing latest rule IDs

**Related Rules:** 000, 006, 013, 021-024
