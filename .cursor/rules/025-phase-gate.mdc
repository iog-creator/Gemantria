# Rule 025 — Multi-Temporal Analytics Enforcement

**Purpose:**
Enforce ADR-025 temporal analytics implementation with pattern analysis, forecasting, and interactive exploration.

## Must Exist
- `scripts/temporal_analytics.py` (temporal analysis engine)
- `share/exports/temporal_patterns.json` (rolling window results)
- `share/exports/forecast.json` (prediction results)
- `webui/dashboard/ForecastDashboard.tsx` (interactive exploration)

## Must Run
Before PRs touching temporal/forecasting:
```bash
make temporal.analytics  # Rolling windows + change points
make forecast.run        # ARIMA/statistical forecasting
```

## Schema Validation
- Temporal patterns must match `docs/SSOT/temporal-patterns.schema.json`
- Forecast results must match `docs/SSOT/pattern-forecast.schema.json`
- RMSE must be < 0.5 for acceptable forecast quality

## Interactive Requirements
- `ForecastDashboard.tsx` must load forecast data from `/api/forecast`
- Temporal patterns API endpoint must support filtering
- Charts must display uncertainty intervals for forecasts

## Fails if

* Temporal analysis script missing or non-functional
* Export files missing after `make temporal.analytics`
* Forecast RMSE > threshold (0.5)
* UI dashboard fails to load forecast data
* Schema validation errors in exports
