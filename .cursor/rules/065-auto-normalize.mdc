# Rule 065 — Auto-Normalize on Branch Switch & PR Events

## Rationale

To avoid manual reminders, Cursor must run local normalization automatically whenever:

- creating a PR, switching branches, or pushing commits.

## Required Actions (Cursor)

- Run: `make hooks.install` once per repo clone.

- Run: `bash scripts/ops/auto_normalize.sh` before `gh pr create`, after checkout/switch, and before `git push`.

- If normalization reports changes, stage and commit with message:

  `style(ruff): auto-format (Rule-065)` and retry.

- If STRICT guard fails and the event is a tag build, stop and ask PM to fix or disable with justification (Rule-050).

## Evidence

Cursor must paste the tail of `evidence/guard_mcp_catalog.*.prepush.json` when present.
