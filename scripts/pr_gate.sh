# pr_gate.sh - Gate PR merges by required checks only

# Usage: ./scripts/pr_gate.sh <pr-number>
#
# This script checks that only required status checks are pending/running
# and that all required checks have passed. It mirrors the connector-less
# merge strategy used in the merge train.
#
# Required checks (configured in branch protection):
# - ruff: formatting + linting (enforce-ruff.yml)
# - build: CI pipeline (ci.yml)
